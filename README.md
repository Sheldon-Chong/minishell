## My experience with this project

Minishell is arguably regarded as the most difficult team project in the 42 Core Program. Personally, I found that this difficulty stems from 3 main aspects:
1. Edge-cases: As minishell's aim is to imitate the shell, it means there are so many edge cases that need to be handled. Fixing one often causes another case to break, and my coding experience involved juggling and picking between different solutions. 
2. Integration: Minishell consists of two distinct parts, parsing the user input, and executing the user input. Because C is a generally inflexible language, integrating these two parts together seamless
